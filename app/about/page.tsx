          <p>
            My journey in technology started with my curiosity about computers and how they work. As an Information Technology student, I developed an interest in programming and explored different languages such as C, C++, and Python. Through school activities and projects, I gained experience and learned how to solve problems using code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I still have a lot to learn, I enjoy challenging myself and improving my skills. My goal is to become a skilled software developer, create useful applications, and continue growing in the field of technology.
